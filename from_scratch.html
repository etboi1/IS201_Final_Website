            <hr>
            <p>Mistborn takes place on a world called Scadrial, a unique and rather unfriendly world, where ashmounts spew ash seemingly indefinetly into the sky. In addition to these ashmounts, Scadrial is home to many strange phenomena, including:
                <ol>
                    <li>"Magical" powers - actually based on the physics of the world and the manipulation of a form of matter in the cosmere known as investiture
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allomancy - ingesting and "burning" certain types of metal to activate powers</li>
                            <li>Feruchemy - wearing metal on the body to store physical/mental attributes such as speed, health, strength, memories, and intelligence for later enhanced use</li>
                            <li>Hemalurgy - piercing the body with metal to grant new allomantic or feruchemical abilities. Requires the death of an Allomancer or Feruchemist possessing desired ability</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Strange Creatures - created through experimental and purposeful usages of Hemalurgy
                        <ul>
                            <li>Kandra - immortals who lack a true form beyond a fleshy mass and possess shapeshifting powers</li>
                            <li>Koloss - brute-like humanoid creatures with enhanced endurance and strength</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Two Shards - pieces of an ancient god, known as Adonalsium, held by mortal beings turned immortal, known as vessels. Each shard embodies one distinct characteristic of the ancient god 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ruin - held by the vessel Ati, Ruin embodies the intent to destroy</li>
                            <li>Preservation - held by the vessel Leras, Preservation embodies the intent to preserve all things as they are</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Although several worlds in the cosmere hold a shard, it is highly uncommon for one system, let alone one world, to hold more than one shard. The only other exception is the Rosharin System, but even there, the three shards reside on different worlds.

            <h1 class="subtitle">Geographic Features</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Scadrial also contains many unique and interesting geographic features. As mentioned before, the land has several ashmounts upon its face, which spew ash into the sky, making it a dark and dreary world. However, the ash also protects the inhabitants from the harsh sun, which is far closer to Scadrial than most other inhabitable worlds. Later, this situation is remedied and Scadrial is moved back to its orignal orbit at a normal distance from its sun. In addition to the ashmounts (which can be seen as volcanic-esque images on the map), Scadrial is also home to the following geographic importances:
                <ul>
                    <li>Terris Dominance: the Terris are the only people to possess the powers of Feruchemy (as it is passed on by bloodline), and they live in the mountanious northern regions.</li>
                    <li>Luthadel: the capital and seat of the Lord Emperor, an immensely powerful Allomancer and Feruchemist who rules the Final Empire (the land featured on the map)</li>
                    <li>The Pits of Hathsin: the hell-like mine where slaves are used to mine atium, a metal which is the body of Ruin and which can be burned to access an incredibly powerful allomantic ability</li>
                    <li>The Elendel Basin: the lighter white portion of the map features the Elendel Basin, which is the known inhabited lands in the Mistborn Era 2 Series</li>
                    <li>Elendel: the capital of The Elendel Basin and the seat of the democratic government in Mistborn Era 2</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Check out this cool tableau data vizualization to learn more about how Mistborn compares to Brandon Sanderson's other books, as well as it's place in the wider cosmere!</p>
            <p>Some pointers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on a name to see which books the character appears in, which universe those books are in, and what group they're a part of</li>
                    <li>Hover over a book circle to see how many total characters are in the book</li>
                    <li>Hover over a group circle for the same</li>
                    <li>The color indicates what universe the character/book/group is in (not all of Sanderson's books are in The Cosmere)</li>
                </ul>
